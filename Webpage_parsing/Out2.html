  Filamentous fungi produce diverse secondary metabolites (SMs) essential to their ecology and adaptation. Although each SM is typically produced by only a handful of species, global SM production is governed by widely conserved transcriptional regulators in conjunction with other cellular processes, such as development. We examined the interplay between the taxonomic narrowness of SM distribution and the broad conservation of global regulation of SM and development in
  <em>
   Aspergillus
  </em>
  , a diverse fungal genus whose members produce well-known SMs. Evolutionary analysis of the 2,124 genes comprising the 262 SM pathways in four
  <em>
   Aspergillus
  </em>
  species showed that most SM pathways were species-specific, that the number of SM gene orthologs was significantly lower than that of orthologs in primary metabolism, and that the few conserved SM orthologs typically belonged to non-homologous SM pathways. RNA sequencing of two master transcriptional regulators of SM and development,
  <em>
   veA
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   mtfA,
  </em>
  showed that the effects of deletion of each gene, especially
  <em>
   veA
  </em>
  , on SM pathway regulation were similar in
  <em>
   A. fumigatus
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   A. nidulans
  </em>
  , even though the underlying genes and pathways regulated in each species differed. In contrast, examination of the role of these two regulators in development, where 94% of the underlying genes are conserved in both species showed that whereas the role of
  <em>
   veA
  </em>
  is conserved,
  <em>
   mtfA
  </em>
  regulates development in the homothallic
  <em>
   A. nidulans
  </em>
  but not in the heterothallic
  <em>
   A. fumigatus
  </em>
  . Thus, the regulation of these highly conserved developmental genes is divergent, whereas&#8211;despite minimal conservation of target genes and pathways&#8211;the global regulation of SM production is largely conserved. We suggest that the evolution of the transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolism in
  <em>
   Aspergillus
  </em>
  represents a novel type of regulatory circuit rewiring and hypothesize that it has been largely driven by the dramatic turnover of the target genes involved in the process.

  Chromatin remodelling regulates processes such as DNA repair, recombination, replication and transcription. Histone acetylation/deacetylation, methylation/demethylation and the associated binding of non-histone proteins, such as heterochromatin protein-1 (HepA) profoundly alter the chromatin landscape and associated gene expression profiles in toxigenic
  <em>
   Aspergilli
  </em>
  and pathogenic
  <em>
   Fusarium
  </em>
  species. These processes proved to be important for controlling the ON/ OFF state of SM biosynthetic genes as well as the fine tuning of their expression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, we present the dynamic process of histone H3 demethylation by a jumonji-type H3K4 demethylase termed KdmB. The purified enzyme removes the methyl mark from tri-methylated histone substrate
  <em>
   in vitro
  </em>
  . Furthermore, LC-MS/MS profiling of
  <em>
   A. nidulans
  </em>
  histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs) revealed increases in global H3K4me3 levels in
  <em>
   kdmB&#916;
  </em>
  . Remarkably, upon
  <em>
   kdmB
  </em>
  deletion most of the SM clusters expressed in our culture condition such as sterigmatocystin, penicillin, terrequinone and orsellinic acid were downregulated. In order to determine the locus specific KdmB targets and the functionality of observed HPTMs, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis were performed.

  <em>
   Aspergillus
  </em>
  is a ubiquitous and phenotypically diverse genus of filamentous Ascomycota, many of which play key roles as fermenters in food production, platforms for biotechnology and industrial production of enzymes and chemicals, plant and opportunistic animal pathogens, and agents of agricultural toxigenesis and biomass conversion for bioenergy. As part of a DOE Joint BioEnergy Institute initiative to characterize the entire genus, the JGI plans to sequence, assemble, and annotate the genomes of each of the ~300 species of the genus
  <em>
   Aspergillus
  </em>
  . To accomplish this massive task in a timely manner without sacrificing quality, we have sought to streamline our existing processes as well as explore alternative technologies, especially assembly and annotation of long PacBio sequencing reads. Over the past year we have released on MycoCosm the genomes of an additional 24
  <em>
   Aspergillus
  </em>
  sp. with preliminary analyses of their phylogenies, secretomes, and secondary metabolism. The next tranche of 92 species is expected soon.

  <em>
   Aspergillus fumigatus
  </em>
  is the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogen causing invasive fungal infections in immunosuppressed individuals. Limitations in antifungal therapy arise from non-specific symptoms of infection, poor diagnostics and comparatively few options for treatment. Novel antifungal therapy approaches target fungal-specific pathways that are essential for virulence. One potential example is the biosynthesis of the essential amino acid histidine. Bacteria, plants und fungi produce histidine via a highly conserved pathway, in
  <em>
   A. fumigatus
  </em>
  encoded by eight genes. In contrast, animals and humans do not synthesize histidine and satisfy their demand via nutritional uptake. Here we demonstrate that lack of histidine biosynthesis due to genetic abrogation of the gene encoding imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase (HisB) causes histidine auxotrophy and virulence attenuation in four virulence models:
  <em>
   Galleria mellonella
  </em>
  , murine pulmonary aspergillosis, murine systemic infection and murine keratitis. In agreement with the
  <em>
   in vivo
  </em>
  importance of histidine biosynthesis, the HisB inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol (3-AT) reduced the virulence of the
  <em>
   A. fumigatus
  </em>
  wildtype in
  <em>
   Galleria mellonella
  </em>
  . In line with a crucial role of histidine in cellular handling of metals due to its chelator activity, HisB-deficiency decreased the resistance of
  <em>
   A. fumigatus
  </em>
  to a variety of metals including iron, zinc, nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese. Taken together, this study reveals (i) limited histidine availability in different
  <em>
   A. fumigatus
  </em>
  host niches and (ii) the histidine biosynthetic pathway as target for novel antifungal therapy approaches. .

 Sclerotia formation in
 <em>
  Aspergillus niger
 </em>

  Sclerotia are compact mycelial masses with hardened, thick walls and a less dense stroma. They play a role in dormancy, serving to survive adverse environmental conditions and are considered to be an important prerequisite for sexual development. Several environmental factors have been shown to be correlated to the production of sclerotia, such as absence or presence of light, medium composition, oxygen availability and temperature.
  <em>
   Aspergillus niger
  </em>
  is a biotechnologically important fungus which is only known to proliferate asexually. Sclerotia formation of naturally isolated strains of
  <em>
   A. niger
  </em>
  has only be recently reported in certain
  <em>
   A. niger
  </em>
  strains grown on specific medium containing raisins, other fruits or rice. We previously described an
  <em>
   Aspergillus niger
  </em>
  mutant (
  <em>
   scl-2
  </em>
  ) displaying a reduced conidiation phenotype and forming abundant sclerotia on commonly used rich medium agar plates not supporting sclerotium formation in the WT. In this study, we characterized the sclerotia forming mutant (
  <em>
   scl-2
  </em>
  ) in detail. Several lines of evidence support that the multicellular structures are indeed sclerotia:
  <em>
   i)
  </em>
  Safranin staining of microscopic coupes of the sclerotia-like structures produced showed the typical cellular structure of a cell dense outer layer and a less dense inside in the sclerotium,
  <em>
   ii)
  </em>
  formation of the sclerotia-like structures is inhibited by light iii) dependent on the oxidative state of the mycelium requiring a functional
  <em>
   noxA
  </em>
  /
  <em>
   noxR
  </em>
  -dependent NADPH oxidase complex. Genome-wide expression analysis of the
  <em>
   scl-2
  </em>
  mutant suggests specific sclerotium dependent production of indoloterpenes. Inspection of gene expression data available for
  <em>
   Aspergillus niger
  </em>
  which includes over 150 growth conditions revealed that three secondary metabolite gene clusters of which two are indicated to be related to indoloterpene synthesis were uniquely expressed in sclerotia.
